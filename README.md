# lode [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/erochest/lode.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/erochest/lode)

An atom package for editing MD+RDFa.

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `apm install lode`

### Working on the Development Version

To use the development version, clone it to a local directory and install it from that directory with `apm`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:erochest/lode.git
apm develop lode ./lode
```

You'll need to open a new Atom window or reload the current one (with the *Window: Reload* command). Any time you change or update the package, you'll also need to reload to see the changes.
